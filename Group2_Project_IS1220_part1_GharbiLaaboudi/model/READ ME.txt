Hello,
As marked in the project report, DiagrammeGlobal is not a Diagramme containing all the methods, but is only here to have a global view of the project's structure.
Also, the different diagrams contain only the required methods and attributes needed for the part that they cover as it is clearer and easier to read.
Finally we used the free and cross-platform Violet UML-Editor to make our diagrams.
Thank you for your understanding.
