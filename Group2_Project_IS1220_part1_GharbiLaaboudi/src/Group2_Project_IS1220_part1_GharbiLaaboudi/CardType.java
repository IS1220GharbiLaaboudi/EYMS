/**
 * There are three different types of cards. The basic fidelity card is the card given by default, at registration, to any user. 
 * This card simply allows to access to special offers that are provided by the restaurant. The point fidelity card enables a client
 * to gain a point for each 10 euros spent in the restaurant and won't be able to access to the special offers.
 * Once he/she will reach 100 points she will receive a 10% discount on the next order. The lottery fidelity card holder will have a certain
 * probability to gain his/her meal for free each day.
